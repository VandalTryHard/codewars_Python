Circular Primes
Based on Project Euler problem 35

A circular prime is a prime in which every circular permutation of that number is also prime.
Circular permutations are created by rotating the digits of the number, for example: 197, 971, 719.
One-digit primes are circular primes by definition.

Complete the function that dertermines if a number is a circular prime.

There are 100 random tests for numbers up to 10000.
